# Wine Quality Analysis Through Generalized Linear Model and Hypothesis
Predicting the Quality of Red Wine using Linear model, ANOVA and Hypothesis testing with Data Visualization and Analysis.

# Dataset
The dataset used here is Wine Quality Data set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. I have attached the csv file needed for the regression task - wineQualityReds.csv The same can also be found here https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

# Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):

1. fixed acidity
2. volatile acidity
3. citric acid
4. residual sugar
5. chlorides
6. free sulfur dioxide
7. total sulfur dioxide
8. density
9. pH
10. sulphates
11. alcohol
12. Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)

# Language used
R

# Platform
RStudio

# Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. The repo contains the code for prediction task and the dataset as csv file.
3. Run the R code in RStudio to see the results.

# Abstract
  This project will explore wine dataset for red wine quality. The objective is to explore which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines. As interesting relationships in the data are discovered, produce and refine plots to illustrate them. First try to get a feel of the variables on their own and then try to find out the correlation between them and the Wine Quality with other factors thrown. Finally a linear model is created to predict the outcome of a test set data. Various methods are performed to find the actual quality of wine. It also proves that the better prediction can be made if selected features (variables) are being considered rather than considering all the features.
